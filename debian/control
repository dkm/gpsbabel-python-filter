Description: GPS file conversion plus transfer to/from GPS units
 GPSBabel converts waypoints, tracks, and routes from one format to
 another, whether that format is a common mapping format like Delorme,
 Streets and Trips, or even a serial upload or download to a GPS unit
 such as those from Garmin and Magellan.
 .
 GPSBabel supports dozens of data formats and will be useful for tasks
 such as geocaching, mapping, and converting from one GPS unit to another.
